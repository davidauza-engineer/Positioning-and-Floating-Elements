              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
               son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                far beyond the world of known physics.
              <br><br>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been 
              created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
              A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a 
              special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
              of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
              <br><br>
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to 
              pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles 
              and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like 
              spit in the ocean.
              <br><br>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around 
              it.
              <br><br>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning 
              of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
              <br><br>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <span class="in-paragraph-links">the first sliver of 
              cosmic time</span> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac 
              of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — 
              so-called <span class="in-paragraph-links">gravitational waves</span> — the signature of a universe 
              being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of 
              a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his 
              colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
